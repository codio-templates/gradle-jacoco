## Integrating with Canvas

Codio integrates with Canvas using [LTI](https://codio.com/docs/classes/lti/lti1_0/). A Canvas admin will need to follow the steps outlined in the documentation.

## Grading the Student Work

For work to be auto-graded and sent to Canvas, the submissions need to be [marked as complete](https://codio.com/docs/content/authoring/assessments/submitcomplete/). There are three ways to mark a submission as complete:

* Students can mark their submission as complete. This will trigger an early grading of the submission. Once done they can no longer make any changes to their work.
* Instructor marks the submissions as complete. This is done from the teacher dashboard. Prior to the deadline, students can alter their work as needed.
* Set an end of unit date. Once the date has been reached, student submissions will automatically be marked as complete, and the grading will begin.
